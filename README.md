#Bifrost
A remote code execution framework over RabbitMQ.

Provides a callable interface like Java executor service. Code is executed remotely using RabbitMQ as communication channel.

##Quickstart Guide
The basic workflow goes like this:

* On server side, open connection to RMQ cluster, create ExecutionServer, start() and wait for commands.
* On client side, open connection to RMQ Cluster, create Executor and keep submitting Callable<T> objects.

###Connection to cluster
Create a <i>Connection</i> object.

    Connection connection = new Connection(Lists.newArrayList("localhost"));

    //Start the connection
    connection.start();

    //Do whatever

    //Stop the connection
    connection.stop();

###RemoteCallable

The basic entity used is the <i>RemoteCallable<T></i> template. This object is json serialized and forwarded to the remote executor. You can derive this class to create your own executor.

    class TestAction extends RemoteCallable<Void> {

        public TestAction() {
            super("test");   //Set some name in the constructor
        }

        @Override
        public Void call() throws Exception {
            //Implement your method
            System.out.println("Hello World");
            return null;
        }
    }

The <i>HttpCallCommand<T></i> is a callable that can be used to make remote HTTP service calls.

###Server
The server component takes care of actually running the callable that you have sent from the client. To create a server use the following builder:

    RemoteCallExecutionServer<Void> executionServer = RemoteCallExecutionServer.<Void>builder(TestAction.class)
                                                                            .objectMapper(mapper)
                                                                            .connection(connection)
                                                                            .concurrency(10)
                                                                            .requestQueue("bifrost-send")
                                                                            .build();

    executionServer.start(); //Start the server
    ...
    executionServer.stop(); //To stop the server

###Client
The client interface is like a standard Java ExecutorService. To use it, create builder like the following:

    BifrostExecutor<Map<String,Object>> executor = BifrostExecutor.<Map<String,Object>>builder(HttpCallCommand.class)
                    .connection(connection)
                    .objectMapper(mapper)
                    .requestQueue("bifrost-send")
                    .responseQueue("bifrost-recv")
                    .executorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))
                    .build();

    //To submit job and wait for response
    Future<Void> result = scheduler.submit(new TestAction());
    result.get();

    //To submit job and not wait for response use a RemoteTask<T> wrapper
    scheduler.submit(new RemoteTask<Void>(new TestAction());

    //To stop the executor
    executor.shutdown();
